# Energy Storage Management

Purpose of This Code

This code creates a custom reinforcement learning environment for an energy storage system using the Gym library. The environment simulates a system where an agent can buy, sell, or hold energy based on fluctuations in energy prices. The goal of the agent is to maximize its total reward (profit) by making optimal decisions regarding energy transactions.

The agent interacts with the environment, selects different actions, and the environment responds accordingly. Over time, the agent learns to develop an effective strategy to maximize profit or minimize losses.

What is Needed to make an envirnment in Gymnasim envirnment?

1- Import Libraries (Gym, NumPy)

2- Create a Class inheriting from gym.Env

3- Define init() (State space, Action space, Parameters)

4- Define reset() (Reset state)

5- Define step(action) (Update state, reward, and termination)

6- Define render() (Show current state)

Sets up a Gym environment in Google Colab

Importing Libraries

Imports NumPy, a library used for numerical operations and random number generation.
Imports Gym, an OpenAI toolkit used to create and train reinforcement learning environments.
Imports spaces, which defines the state space (possible conditions of the environment) and the action space (possible actions the agent can take).
