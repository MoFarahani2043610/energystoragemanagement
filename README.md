# Energy Storage Management

Purpose of This Code

This code creates a custom reinforcement learning environment for an energy storage system using the Gym library. The environment simulates a system where an agent can buy, sell, or hold energy based on fluctuations in energy prices. The goal of the agent is to maximize its total reward (profit) by making optimal decisions regarding energy transactions.

The agent interacts with the environment, selects different actions, and the environment responds accordingly. Over time, the agent learns to develop an effective strategy to maximize profit or minimize losses.

# Features

* Custom Gymnasium Environment: Simulates an energy storage system.

* Action-Based Decision Making: Allows the agent to buy, sell, or hold energy.

* Dynamic Energy Pricing: Incorporates fluctuating energy prices.

* State Representation: Tracks energy storage levels and price variations.

* Optimized Learning: Enables reinforcement learning models to develop efficient energy trading strategies

# Components of the Environment

1. State and Action Spaces

* State Space: Represents the energy level in storage (continuous values) and the current energy price.

* Action Space:

0 → Hold (do nothing)

1 → Buy energy (increase storage, pay price)

2 → Sell energy (decrease storage, earn price)

2. Environment Initialization

- The environment starts with a random energy level and energy price.

- The maximum storage capacity and energy price range are defined as environment attributes.

3. Reset Function

- Resets the environment to an initial state.

- Randomizes the starting energy level and price.

- Resets the total accumulated reward.

4. Step Function

- Takes an action and updates the environment state.

- Implements rules for buying, selling, or holding energy.

- Calculates the reward based on the transaction.

- Updates the energy level and generates a new random price.

- Ends the episode if the total reward drops below a defined threshold
